An Introduction To Applied Bioinformatics
=========================================

Bioinformatics, as I see it, is the application of the tools of computer science (things like programming languages, algorithms, and databases) to address biological problems (for example, inferring the evolutionary relationship between a group of organisms based on fragments of their genomes, or understanding if or how the community of microorganisms that live in my gut changes if I modify my diet). Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field, largely in response to the vast increase in the quantity of data that biologists now grapple with. Students from varied disciplines (e.g., biology, computer science, statistics, and biochemistry) and stages of their educational careers (undergraduate, graduate, or postdoctoral) are becoming interested in bioinformatics.

I teach bioinformatics at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Northern Arizona University. This repository contains some of the materials that I've developed in these courses, and represents an initial attempt to organize these materials in a standalone way. In some cases, I'm just linking out to other materials for now.

Disclaimer
----------

**This project is in very early development stage.** It's not ready for prime-time by any means, but I fall firmly into the "publish early, publish often" mindset, hence its public availability. I am very interested in feedback in the form of email (gregcaporaso@gmail.com) or [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

The code in the iab module is **not sufficiently tested, documented, or optimized for production use**. As code reaches those quality standards it will be ported to [scikit-bio](http://www.scikit-bio.org). I do not recommend using the code in the iab module outside of these notebooks. In other words, don't `import iab` outside of the notebooks - if you want access to the functionality in your own code, you should `import skbio`.

Currently, the **best example of where I'm hoping to go with these materials** is the [multiple sequence alignment](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/blob/master/algorithms/4-multiple-sequence-alignment.ipynb) chapter.

Outline
-------

  4. Multiple sequence alignment (contains an exercise)
  5. Read mapping and clustering
2. Applications
  1. Studying biological diversity

How to read the book
--------------------

There are two ways to read *An Introduction To Applied Bioinformatics*:

* The *recommended* way to read the book is to download and run the IPython notebooks interactively. You can do this by cloning the GitHub repository, installing the package and its dependencies, and running the notebooks interactively. Instructions for doing this are provided below in the **Installation** section.

* The *easiest* way to read the book is to view the static notebooks online using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). You should [start here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/blob/master/Index.ipynb).

If you're new to using IPython or the IPython Notebook, you can find more information at the [IPython website](http://www.ipython.org/), [IPython Notebook website](http://ipython.org/notebook), and the [IPython Notebook example gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).

Installation
------------

If you're going to read the book interactively (recommended), you'll need to clone this repository, install some dependencies, and launch the IPython Notebook. For example, the following commands should work for Linux and Mac OS X users:

    git clone https://github.com/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics.git
    cd An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics
    pip install numpy
    pip install .

Finally, launch the IPython Notebook to get started (be sure that you're in the ``An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics`` directory when you run this command):

    ipython notebook --pylab inline Index.ipynb

That's it!

If you'd like to install the book's dependencies manually (or some other way than using pip), here's what you'll need:

- [Python](http://www.python.org/) 2.7
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) >= 1.7
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) >= 0.13.0
- [matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org/) >= 1.1.0
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) >= 0.13.1
- [IPython](http://www.ipython.org/) >= 2.0.0
- [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
- [pyzmq](http://zeromq.github.io/pyzmq/)
- [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
- [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/) == 0.1.1
- [biom-format](http://www.biom-format.org) < 2.0.0 (temporarily, soon to be 2.0.0)
- [pyqi](http://biocore.github.io/pyqi/doc/index.html)
- [future](http://python-future.org/)

More information
