WELCOME.  I SEE YOU HAVE DECIDED TO DELVE INTO THE MAD WORLD OF THE .AEP

If you clone the repo, the aep should open with all resources.  We use Avenir Next LT Pro for our typeface, so it won't render correctly if you don't have those fonts.  

The audio files used for the narrative are too big for the repository, as are the frame by frame render outputs, so the compositions relating to the narration will be broken.  

OTHER THINGS TO NOTE:
Oh come on, be nice and attribute us.  CC-BY-NC-SA
Data and protocols visually represented in the presentation may be abstracted or modified in minimal ways for the sake of simplicity/communication.
