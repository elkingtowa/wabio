Functions for the nucleotide analysis pipeline
These are tools to analyze large populations of phage, and should be called on large subsets

1) calculate kmer deviation for a list of phage defined in a configuration file. 
	1a) output a file of deviations for each kmer for each phage - optional 
	1b) output a distance matrix -optional
	1c) output a nexus file with distances between all phage - default behavior. 
2) calclate kmer difference index for a list of phage defined in a configuration file
	2a) produce a plot of first 10 sequences defined
	2b) save a file with kmer difference index for each window
