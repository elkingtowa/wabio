Usage:

Import DNA_align and pyplot

import DNA_align

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

easy peasyImport your data from a Fasta File

Make a file object from your fasta file

sequence=open(‘Fasta_File.txt’,'r’)


Convert Your File Object to A String

sequence=DNA_align.fasta_to_string(sequence)

now sequence is a string, which is way easier to deal with

Reverse Complement

sequence=DNA_align.reverse(sequence)

sequence=DNA_align.complement(sequence)

‘atgcaata’->’tattgcat’

Overlap N Base Pairs

DNA_align.crush(forward,reverse,N_BasePairs)

This will return the count of matched bps and the longest run of pbs in a tuple (count, longest)

Overlap Up to N Base Pairs

align=DNA_align.align(forward,reverse,N_BasePairs)

This will return a list of tuples [ (pairs_overlapped,(count,longest) , ...]

Now to Plot It

plt.plot([ x[1][0] for x in align])  #plot the number of agreement

plt.plot(x[1][1] for x in align]) #plot the record # of runs

plt.show() #show the graph
